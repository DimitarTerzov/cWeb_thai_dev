So just that you know the rules for the evening, each(music) candidate will have the same amount of time to speak and which will be five minutes to make her or his case. 
<Sync time="216.476"/>
The candidates, #uh, the order of the candidates was determined by a lottery. They drew ro~ #uhhhhhh, they drew numbers in room two eight sev~ #uh, two zero seven away from the public and so the candidate who drew first will go first.

We have the order up here [lipsmack] and we believe this is a great opportunity for each, #uh, city counselor, #uh [laugh] sorry, school counselor candidate too [cough] to address the citizens of Medford.

You also need to know that we do have a timekeeper for those five minutes. Our timekeeper sitting over there, we'll be using a color card system.

Thank you, Henry. Thank you Ward Six. Friends and neighbors, my name is Michael Ruggiero and I wanna thank you for the opportunity to continue to serve you on the school committee. 
<Sync time="369.566"/>
In these past two years, we have completed many projects that were important to all of us. Beyond selecting a new Superintendent, we restructured the science and the mathematics curriculums. 
<Sync time="382.851"/>
We improved communications between the &lt;initial&gt; PTO &lt;/initial&gt;'s and the school department. 
<Sync time="387.789"/>
We've begun to address some of the inequalities between our two middle schools, but much work remains and I hope you will allow me to focus on two main areas.
<Sync time="399.789"/>
That I believe present the biggest challenge moving forward for Medford, health and transparency.
<Sync time="407.431"/>

<Sync time="414.349"/>
[cough] Here are the issues that are ch~ are facing our cities in regards to health and here are my proposed solutions. 
<Sync time="422.259"/>
First, while not unique to Medford, food insecurity and obesity are serious issues that we need to address. 
<Sync time="431.152"/>
Currently, about one in six of our students suffer with obesity, problems that can later develop into diabetes, hypertension, and even cancer. 
<Sync time="442.49"/>
Also, some of our students don't know when they're gonna eat next. I propose a radical revision to our meals program.
<Sync time="452.181"/>
While we are slowly moving towards a universal breakfast program in Medford, we need to finalize this program now. 
<Sync time="460.567"/>
Ensuring that our students have complete meals to start their day. We have some great people in the district working on nutrition, but the school committee needs more direct control over how our meal program is administered. 
<Sync time="475.054"/>
Pizza should not be the default option for every meal. 
<Sync time="478.728"/>
Rather than looking at food services as an income-generating source, meaning basic standards by the &lt;initial&gt; FDA &lt;/initial&gt; and the &lt;initial&gt; USDA &lt;/initial&gt;, we need to actually ha~ teach lunch like any other class.
<Sync time="492.394"/>
Food is not just fuel but it is the foundation for our educational program. Once food insecurity is addressed, we must make sure that recess is a part of every child's life. 
<Sync time="504.199"/>
We can't expect children to sit for hours unless they have time to run and frolic. Unstructured time is not only healthy but it allows the mind to digest what is learned in class. 
<Sync time="518.935"/>
I would also like to open up enrollment for students in all sports. I remember as a chunky child in high school, being cut from my basketball team and in retrospect, while I certainly didn't deserve a spot on the starting five.
<Sync time="533.079"/>
Running s~ sprint drills would have been a great use of my time. If a kid wants to play, we should let them and we should make sure that there's time in their schedule for them to do it even if they're not ready for the starting lineup.
<Sync time="547.013"/>
In regards to health, I'm heartened by Charlie Baker's banning of vaping, temporary ban, but I believe we need a citywide ban on the sale of these products within our borders. 
<Sync time="558.832"/>
I've spoken with parents worried about the encroachment of vaping, not only in our middle schools but also in our elementary school too. 
<Sync time="567.334"/>
Finally, I would like to make our schools more accessible and transparent for our parents. We need to post our materials online, not just the agendas. 
<Sync time="578.825"/>
As a member of the school committee, every week I'm given a big thick packet of materials, reports, planning curriculum, and the progress of our schools.
<Sync time="589.431"/>
Other than the confidential materials, we need to post these packets online. Many other cities in our neighborhood have implemented this plan and it has increased parent participation and understanding in every city that has tried it. 
<Sync time="603.412"/>
It is difficult to follow what we're saying over here when you don't have the papers in your hands. 
<Sync time="609.668"/>
As a member of the school committee, my top priority has been to the education of our children. 
<Sync time="616.0"/>
As a former teacher with over seven years of experience, I hope you join me, Michael Ruggiero, as we keep moving our schools from good to great. Thank you.

<Turn speaker="spk6" startTime="702.702" endTime="859.769">
<Sync time="702.702"/>
[lipsmack] First, communication. [lipsmack] When our kids were young, we really wanted to know more about the schools, but we found that it was somewhat difficult to get that information, so we turned to our neighbors and to social media.
<Sync time="715.423"/>
To see what we could find out. And we always just sort of wondered why it was so hard to hear from the district its own story. 
<Sync time="722.731"/>
#um, #uh, easy, clear, thoughtful and accessible communication is a challenge, but it's achievable, and we need to be focused on that.
<Sync time="733.449"/>
I want our district to do what they can to educate, #um, our families and the community at large on the process of education. 
<Sync time="742.128"/>
So that has changed so dramatically, since we were all kids, right? And the way to foster a connection between home and school starts with meaningful communication.
<Sync time="753.421"/>
Not only about how our child, how how our children are doing in class, but also about how we're teaching what the methodologies are for those parents who are able to support, #um, their children at home.
<Sync time="765.915"/>
[lipsmack] #um, I've already actually started the process of trying to improve communication about what happens in our district with my blogs which I write after each school committee meeting. 
<Sync time="776.272"/>
So these blogs are on my website, which is &lt;initial&gt; WWW &lt;/initial&gt; dot electjenny dot org. So after each school committee meeting, I post a blog that provides a summary. 
<Sync time="785.654"/>
So, sort of the Reader's Digest version of the many hour meetings that happen here in this chamber. 
<Sync time="790.471"/>
#um, if I am elected, I will continue to work to make sure that the district provides and focuses on substantive communication to our families and the community at large.
<Sync time="801.822"/>
[lipsmack] Second, teacher support. So the budget for basic supplies here in Medford is not adequate, and we ask our families to provide supplies as well. 
<Sync time="811.313"/>
Our teachers don't have all of the tools that they need to be as effective as they possibly can. 
<Sync time="817.08"/>
And while that does mean paper, pencils and paper towels, it also means curricula and the professional development required to make those curricula successful.
<Sync time="828.122"/>
[lipsmack] Our teachers are also learners and they deserve our commitment to providing high-quality learning opportunities to them.
<Sync time="835.627"/>
[lipsmack] Our curriculum subcommittee has not met since twenty seventeen, and I believe that this committee should be paying, #uh, playing a, an integral role in establishing policy about how we evaluate our curricula. 
<Sync time="847.983"/>
So that includes the curricula that we have and whether it is working, it includes curricula that we don't have and need, and it includes the process of how we select curricula for the district.

<Turn speaker="spk6" startTime="861.081" endTime="956.003">
<Sync time="861.081"/>
We've purchased two curricula in the last year alone, and in other cases, we know that, for example, with our middle school science and our elementary math curricula, those curricula do not completely align to our Massachusetts State frameworks. 
<Sync time="874.246"/>
As a certified curriculum developer and evaluator, I will make it a priority to make sure that we establish policies that support regular review and assessment of our curricula because our teachers deserve nothing less.
<Sync time="885.128"/>
[lipsmack] As I thought about those two priorities, and I made this decision to run for office for the first time, I really thought about, #um, what it would take to see positive momentum and change.
<Sync time="895.259"/>
And what those actions would really be, and that led me to my final two priorities. So, number three is funding, and really, you might argue that that's number one or number four, it wraps around everything else that we're talking about.
<Sync time="907.907"/>
I became involved in fundraising here in Medford at my own children's school and then as a founder, #uh, one of the co-founders of the, #um, Medford City Wide Elementary Alliance, which last year raised nearly twenty-eight thousand dollars for our four elementary schools. 
<Sync time="922.866"/>
And fundraising pays for so much here in Medford, you could almost argue that it pays for too much. 
<Sync time="929.116"/>
Fundraising can't though, apply for, #um, curricula support and professional development.
<Sync time="936.087"/>
So we really need to make efforts and progress to make sure that we are funding our programs and our schools, and our teachers appropriately.
<Sync time="945.214"/>
And finally, my last priority is strategic planning, which also, sort of wraps around all of these goals. I've always been focused on moving forward, nothing is perfect, but we need to take careful steps together.

Hi. Thank you for coming out on such a stormy night. I'm Melanie McLaughlin. I'm running for Medford School Committee, and I'm here respectfully asking for your vote. 
<Sync time="987.747"/>
I'm going to have a few minutes where I'm going to share a little bit with you, #um, of my background, my values and motivation, and my experience and plan for School Committee.
<Sync time="998.636"/>
I want to share my background with you because I think our background informs who we are and what we do in our lives. 
<Sync time="1004.897"/>
My personal background is such that, #um, I was, I was a product of public schools, Lawrence Public Schools.
<Sync time="1011.8"/>
And, #um, I am the fourth and youngest of a teenage mom who experienced, #um, significant addiction issues as a young woman. 
<Sync time="1022.163"/>
She, #um, experienced alcoholism and lost custody of all four of her children, ultimately.
<Sync time="1029.794"/>
[lipsmack] It was my kindergarten teacher that first reached out, #um, to &lt;initial&gt; DCF &lt;/initial&gt;, letting them know that I was being neglected and abused and my child~ I mean, as were my brothers. 
<Sync time="1040.525"/>
It would be eight more years before I would actually leave my home. And while I listened, while I am referring to Steve Pemberton, another candidate for office, I want to acknowledge that none of these things were my fault, but they are my responsibility.

I want to share that they were beacons of hope in my life as a child that made all the difference, from a grandmother to that kindergarten teacher, an aunt, a college professor, a social worker.

And all others who reached out and believed in a child who didn't look like they were going to have much opportunity in life.
<Sync time="1073.163"/>
[lipsmack] The biggest thing in my life that I wanted was a family of my own. I'm proud to say that I am the mom of three beautiful children today, #um, who have been in the Medford Public Schools for the past thirteen years. 
<Sync time="1084.575"/>
My oldest child was in advanced placement courses. She was a member of the National Honor Society, Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

[lipsmack] They've taught me a lot through the years and I put myself through, #uh, Fitchburg undergraduate~ Fitchburg State College undergraduate, and I have two degrees in human services and communications.

One degree, Human Services, and communications media. And two years ago, I went to get my masters in education policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

Professionally, I'm a filmmaker, #uh, a community activist and an investigative journalist.

[lipsmack] My values and, #uh, motivation. Given my background, I think it's very important that every child has equal access to public education. 
<Sync time="1141.349"/>
I think it is the great divider in our community for what gives us access outside in the in the world and allows us to accomplish. 
<Sync time="1148.771"/>
I've always been an advocate for children and I always will be. I've been fortunate with my own background, that my brothers and I were able to break the cycle in our lives. 
<Sync time="1157.052"/>
Not everybody else has that Not everybody has that opportunity. I feel it's a public responsibility for me to advocate for every child and every family.

It's what my aunt and the beacons of hope in my life would have expected of me, and what I would feel as a as a responsibility for me.

<Sync time="1179.308"/>
We have the third-largest food insecurity in the state behind New Bedford and Lowell. We have a sixty two-million-dollar budget for our schools and I think we should be thinking about our social and emotional needs of our children in that budget. 
<Sync time="1191.927"/>
I think it's really important that if we don't address the social and emotional needs of our children, they won't be able to learn and we will have a widening achievement and opportunity gap #um.

Regarding Charter Schools, I think that a lot of families see Charter Schools as a choice for other opportunities for them.

<Sync time="1218.315"/>

My experience, motivation, presence in the community and commitment to the Medford Educational Community enable me to achieve results no matter what the obstacles may be. 
<Sync time="1352.863"/>
I look fondly back to the sixth grade, to a teacher that I had, Rosemarie Accomando. 
<Sync time="1351.737"/>
She was a great lady, she instilled in all her charges that you can do whatever you want to do and remember if it's a challenge it won't be insurmountable if you stick to it and do it. 
<Sync time="1371.173"/>
That's why I continue to have an interest in Medford education. I taught in Medford, I coached the soccer team.
<Sync time="1378.092"/>
I went on to become a criminal investigator for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and I wrote high school sports for many of the publications during the eighties and nineties here in Medford. 
<Sync time="1388.319"/>
I have firsthand knowledge what a lack of an education can do to an individual. [lipsmack] I have and will continue to work diligently for keeping our class sizes small.
<Sync time="1400.543"/>
Update our curriculum district-wide according with state mandates, seek out additional stat~ state-federal funding. Create new vocational programs in robotics technologies.

<Sync time="1423.349"/>
Offer quality and meaningful extracurricular programs, create a capital improvement plan for all our school buildings and properties. Our new schools are almost twenty years old now. 
<Sync time="1434.59"/>
We have to maintain them and make sure that they're up to top-notch and that no child is cold or warm accord~ according to the weather and that our faculty have a safe and secure place to teach in every day. 
<Sync time="1448.436"/>
I've balanced the budget in tough fiscal times and I'm prepared to do it again, and I also ensure every child's academic needs and successes are a product of their education here in Medford.

I'm an advocate and the voice for proven programs that will provide Medford's children the ability to flourish and succeed in today's world.

The school budget is the foundation upon successful educational results are built. Across the nation, school districts report financial failings regularly. 
<Sync time="1491.729"/>
We in Medford worked hard to make sure that your tax dollars are utilized to maximize the economic and educational programs for each and every single child in our public schools.
<Sync time="1504.822"/>
If new prog~ programs in the course of study are initiated, it is imperative that we as adults request that every vendor be thoroughly researched so the texts and materials are delivered to the school department in advance of classes.
<Sync time="1519.784"/>
In a timely fashion, and to make sure that and our teachers and students have all the materials that they need to successfully complete that course in that given year.
<Sync time="1528.337"/>
As always, I'll bring concerns of parents and students to the school committee table. Parental involvement is crucial in our child's school life. 
<Sync time="1536.831"/>
I believe that parents and schools must work in unison to create the best educational possibilities. Our parents have a nurturing and protective nature with respect to their children.

Good evening everybody. #um, my name's Mea Quinn Mustone and I would like to start with, #um, my cousin out in California had the opportunity to watch our candidate statements on Medford Community Media.
<Sync time="1649.001"/>
And she called me to say, #um, what was the story with you looking down at your children's names? So apparently I was very nervous and I didn't remember my children's names, so I'm gonna say that my husband Tim and I have six kids. 
<Sync time="1660.884"/>
They are Quinn Teegan, Collin Nevin, Rowan and Declan. So now my cousin Sherry will know that I wasn't that nervous tonight.
<Sync time="1667.993"/>
#um, I am seeking reelection to serve as a member of the Medford School Committee. We currently have one child at Medford high, two at the Andrews and two at the Roberts. 
<Sync time="1677.719"/>
Everyone always says what happened to the sixth one. She is at Arlington Catholic. That was her choice and we supported her. #um, I'm a lifelong resident of Medford as you can probably hear from my accent because my children mock me regularly.
<Sync time="1690.806"/>
And #um, I proudly and humbly ask for your vote in my reelection bid. My work for a more engaging school experience that serves the needs of Medford is not yet done. With your support, I have now served two terms as a school committee member.
<Sync time="1705.775"/>
While many of our goals have been achieved, much work remains. During my time on the school committee, we've addressed important academic issues relevant to all &lt;initial&gt; MPS &lt;/initial&gt; parents. 
<Sync time="1715.565"/>
We have a new science curriculum at the elementary schools, a new math curriculum at the middle schools. 
<Sync time="1720.632"/>
We have new math coaches. We have kindergarten ((aides)) truly in every class and every school after four years and we have the implementation of a new dyslexia screening [lipsmack]
<Sync time="1730.699"/>
The work that remains includes addressing our current middle school science curriculum and our current elementary school English language arts Envision's curriculum. 
<Sync time="1739.95"/>
We also need to advocate for math interventionist, which teachers have said, #um, they would like more, it's almost like a title one that they would be more direct serve as like a title one reading specialist.
<Sync time="1753.462"/>
My agenda going forward is divined by defined by the many hours I've spent talking with parents at my kitchen table, the grocery store, school plays and other places throughout the city. 
<Sync time="1763.161"/>
The list of area~ areas in need of improvement is long. We have discussed reforms around styrofoam tray usage, which I'm excited that there's now gonna be, #uh, waste assessment done to make our schools greener. 
<Sync time="1775.998"/>
#um, the length of recess, food insecurity and free breakfast for all. 
<Sync time="1781.002"/>
I have heard concerns with regards to security, the maintenance of our buildings and grounds, the sex education curriculum, cursive writing instruction, and our cafeteria food options.
<Sync time="1792.418"/>
Parents have asked about our concussion protocol employed by our sports teams, bus issues, which include overcrowded buses, location of bus stops, and the schedules of middle school late buses. 
<Sync time="1803.85"/>
We've also heard about the amount of homework for &lt;initial&gt; K &lt;/initial&gt; through two students, which research shows doesn't really do anything. 
<Sync time="1810.074"/>
#um, our exams and the possibility of snow blizzard bags where you would do your homework on the snow day, so it would not count as a snow day.
<Sync time="1818.985"/>
I know that we have to improve communication with parents. We have to improve our sped services, our STEM activities, our &lt;initial&gt; M &lt;/initial&gt; CAT results, the timing, #um, of the middle school assignment process. 
<Sync time="1831.266"/>
It was, it w~ was done quickly last year, but I support it one hundred percent 'cause we were asking for it for about three years, so I am so thankful that doctor Maurice took that on.
<Sync time="1842.637"/>
#um, we need to improve our summer reading options. The list hasn't changed, #um, in a long time and the use of outdoor spaces, both at the high school and the elementary schools.
<Sync time="1855.624"/>
I've been able to seek out answers and updates and information in some of these areas with our leadership and staff. 
<Sync time="1862.732"/>
The answer wasn't always the one that we hoped for, but we did show a light on parents' concerns and continue the conversation. 
<Sync time="1871.291"/>
I have used my tenure on the school committee to be a voice for parents and I now ask for your continued support. Please join me in investing in our schools and committing ourselves to a future where every child receives a caring, safe, and challenging educational experience. Thanks so much.

#Uh  Hello, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez and I am a candidate for the Medford School Committee. I wanna thank our hosts for giving us the opportunity to speak to the voters. 
<Sync time="1910.015"/>
#uhhhh We were asked to discuss action we would takeif elected, and that's a great question. I'm well versed in both school and municipal issues and believe a solid school committee member must be up to date on both as they are intertwined. 
<Sync time="1923.445"/>
Can our schools handle the load of thousands of apartments on Mr. Gaff in our physical buildings or budgetarily from the increases we'll have to pay to charter schools? No.
<Sync time="1934.659"/>
How about the idea of a forty art district that will force heavy amounts of residential into designated zones as suggested by our current mayor in last night's debate? Definitely not. 
<Sync time="1945.484"/>
That the way to add more tax dollars to Medford to be able to complete school capital projects is to increase our commercial tax breaks. Growth with a vision for sustainability is the key to improving our schools and our quality of life. 
<Sync time="1959.884"/>
My children have always attended title one schools and I understand that they have unique needs and as a school committee member, we need to advocate for those needs. All of our teachers are great.
<Sync time="1971.217"/>
I recently attended the AMCAS meeting and was struck as it was mentioned that one middle school that had more than double the high needs students of the other had the same number of reading support specialists. 
<Sync time="1982.807"/>
One, let that sink in. One. I want to know what the need student to teacher ratio is on that. 
<Sync time="1990.276"/>
Could we be supporting those students better by dividing the time of those specialists differently at the schools as they share the same campus? 
<Sync time="1997.96"/>
This would have zero impact on our budget, but the impact on the children who need that support would be immeasurable. All of our schools need our support.
<Sync time="2008.17"/>
I am the only candidate in any race that has written and been awarded a community preservation grant. Two, in fact. 
<Sync time="2016.398"/>
One was to replace the surfacing at the Roberts Elementary and was for one hundred and nine thousand dollars. 
<Sync time="2023.447"/>
I believe this to be a good use of &lt;initial&gt; CPA &lt;/initial&gt; funds and we need more grants like this. Historic preservation can also be funded with &lt;initial&gt; CPA &lt;/initial&gt; grants. 
<Sync time="2032.857"/>
During my time at &lt;initial&gt; MHS &lt;/initial&gt;, I was a student of doctor Valeriani and he taught me a lot about Medford history, about researching it. 
<Sync time="2041.107"/>
My classmates and I spent countless hours toiling in the basement of the Cambridge courthouse researching the historical origins of our homes and the land it sat on. 
<Sync time="2050.625"/>
I would love to empower our schools to embrace more history, this could be great. Our high school needs work. I would like to open the three-time failed high school grant and see what we can do to make it more attractive. 
<Sync time="2063.896"/>
As the only resident in attendance at the initial School Committee Meeting at &lt;initial&gt; MHS &lt;/initial&gt; about this grant application, I remember it being toted as a dream application. 
<Sync time="2073.811"/>
Our kids don't need a dream, they need a good reality. They need a functioning heating system, one that doesn't require students to dress for the beach in one classroom and a snowstorm and another. 
<Sync time="2086.226"/>
This is a no brainer. Maintenance says that we can't get parts, we need a new system and we need it now.
<Sync time="2092.727"/>
[lipsmack] I am ever and always grateful to our &lt;initial&gt; PTO &lt;/initial&gt;s for the enrichment that they add to our district. They often to pay to bring in speakers to educate our children about things ranging from bullying to the opioid crisis. 
<Sync time="2104.362"/>
Thank you to them for taking care of our social-emotional health of all our students. Let's as a committee tried to combine their purchasing power. 
<Sync time="2113.023"/>
The same speakers at both middle schools would have likely fetched a better rate, a comprehensive bullying speaker package at all of our schools, even more so.
<Sync time="2122.303"/>
I brought this concept to the school committee over a year ago and even suggested a program that was under three thousand dollars for the entire district to have an age-appropriate assembly in each school.

Mental health in our school is an issue we as a committee need to talk about and I feel that conversation is little to none. 
<Sync time="2254.433"/>
I reached out to my peers on social media and stated that if they had an experience they wanted to talk about, to write a letter and use it in a way to better educate some of our staff, administration, and students on this issue. 
<Sync time="2267.517"/>
Within minutes I had a decent amount of individuals reach out to me. The stories I read were horrifying and I have these anonymous letters with me today.

One student mentioned a staff member told them that they needed to stop making up a story for attention. One student had to nearly back to back hospitalizations and while they were there, the school continued to send them work as if they were merely just sick on the couch. 
<Sync time="2292.939"/>
And another student developed an incurable physical disease because of how high their anxiety got and the school continued to believe it was all in their head. 
<Sync time="2301.199"/>
One student mentions they believe students who suffer from mental health issues aren't heard and that mental health is just as important as physical health.
<Sync time="2309.55"/>
We need to reassess our health curriculum to better educate on mental health.

<Turn speaker="spk11" startTime="2315.033" endTime="2489.768">
<Sync time="2315.033"/>
One good thing about our mental health curriculum is the visit of the NAN Project, which is a group of speakers who have dealt with and are currently still dealing with mental health and how they have overcome it or how they are currently dealing with it. 
<Sync time="2326.986"/>
This gives the students who need it the hope of recovery as some feel they may never get to a higher point. One student talks about their (()) and how it helped them. 
<Sync time="2336.536"/>
I wanna clarify that the Medford Public Schools presently are helping students with mental health issues, but from the letters I received, I feel there was always room for improvement.
<Sync time="2346.261"/>
In the four years I attended &lt;initial&gt; MHS &lt;/initial&gt;, I was the personal source of comfort for about four students, one of whom told me they were gonna commit suicide. 
<Sync time="2355.324"/>
I was lucky that I was familiar with the steps to deescalate the situation and help said student with the aid of an &lt;initial&gt; MPS &lt;/initial&gt; staff member. 
<Sync time="2364.215"/>
I have sent these letters to Superintendent Edouard-Vincent in hopes of shining a spotlight on these issues.
<Sync time="2370.027"/>
Another topic I would like to discuss is our Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility or for short &lt;initial&gt; CCSR &lt;/initial&gt;. I was a member myself and my little sister Lacey was a member at the high school and my little brother Leo is currently a member at the Roberts Elementary. 
<Sync time="2384.371"/>
Our students are doing amazing things within this program and it is proving its success one project at a time. Right now, citywide, there are approximately five hundred student leaders. 
<Sync time="2394.527"/>
Over a hundred and fifty of those are at the high school alone. Also at the high school, there are over seventy projects being produced as we speak.
<Sync time="2401.579"/>
Some citywide &lt;initial&gt; CCSR &lt;/initial&gt; projects include the Unmarked Grave for Medford Slaves Project, Free the Pad &lt;initial&gt; ELL &lt;/initial&gt; Give Back Project, and the three &lt;initial&gt; D &lt;/initial&gt; Crosswalks. 
<Sync time="2410.678"/>
Those said projects gain Medford national and local news. Right now the &lt;initial&gt; CCSR &lt;/initial&gt; is on the last year of their main source of finance, the Cummings Foundation Grant. 
<Sync time="2420.516"/>
They applied again this year for an additional a hundred thousand dollars but they won't hear back until May. The &lt;initial&gt; CCSR &lt;/initial&gt; is also funded by the Krystle Campbell Betterment Project, Boston Foundation and many other partners including our (()) Club.
<Sync time="2433.252"/>
The point is if the grants do not come through once this money runs out, it's gone, and the &lt;initial&gt; CCSR &lt;/initial&gt; has proved itself to be a vital part of Medford and less than ten years of operation. 
<Sync time="2443.953"/>
As a school committee member, I would push for the &lt;initial&gt; CCSR &lt;/initial&gt; to be incorporated into our budget as it has shown to have nothing but positive effects on our students and community. 
<Sync time="2453.576"/>
We must remember that we owe it to the students for their hard work and there are some individuals who are taking credits for our students' achievements by attaching their name to it and that needs to end now.
<Sync time="2462.774"/>
Our students are growing stronger by the minute and they are ready to do these community service projects for the betterment of Medford. Please see me after the forum for any more questions you have about the &lt;initial&gt; CCSR &lt;/initial&gt;, about the letters or anything else on my platform. 
<Sync time="2475.808"/>

Hi everybody. First and foremost, I want to thank the Medford Ward Six Committee for hosting candidates night tonight. My name is Kathleen Miles Kreatz, I'm running for reelection to the Memphis School Committee for my third term. 
<Sync time="2516.354"/>
I'm a lifelong Medford resident. I'm a proud graduate of Medford High School and Suffolk University. My husband and son are both proud graduates of Medford High School. In other words, we are full~ fully committed to Medford and we're proud of Mustangs.
<Sync time="2529.359"/>
When reelected, there are many issues that I'd like to address. I will support the vocational teachers.
<Sync time="2535.371"/>
While the &lt;initial&gt; CCL &lt;/initial&gt; metal fabrication, robotics and engineering, and const~ construction cosmetology shops reconfigure to create a productive, highly functioning workspace to maximize the current use the footprint of the school.
<Sync time="2548.411"/>
As an active member of the building and grants subcommittee I most of the the schools are maintained regularly, although our schools are in need of repair at times. The Medford High School complex requires the most continual updates.
<Sync time="2560.228"/>
With the help of Mr. Brown, one of the vocational construction shop teachers, I advocated to create a special committee, #um, to create a master blueprint to develop a longterm renovation vision plan at Medford High School complex.
<Sync time="2573.615"/>
I have a creative idea for historic preservation in our schools. I know there were old pictures of Medford bronze plaques from the old neighborhood schools in storage at Medford High School. 
<Sync time="2583.02"/>
We should begin cataloging preserving and displaying these relics in Medford High School in the b~ in the bistro or other areas in the city. Most importantly, I'm concerned about the rising increase in casual drug use in middle school and high school. 
<Sync time="2595.387"/>
The Michigan model will be utilized to educate students at fifth-grade level. Educating students earlier and providing this education will help support initiatives to help the students re~ re~ resist the dangers of substance abuse.
<Sync time="2608.814"/>
At the middle school level academically, my purposes is for instruction to see how the students are responding to the new math program, illustrative math. At the elementary school, I aspire to shadow the Superintendent on the math learning walks. 
<Sync time="2620.998"/>
Also, I like to observe and participate hands-on while the students are learning from STEAM with the new FOSS science curriculum, I support adding an additional physical education teacher to meet the needs of special education students across our district and vocational students. 
<Sync time="2635.737"/>
With this new &lt;initial&gt; CTE &lt;/initial&gt;, this would assist the &lt;initial&gt; CTE &lt;/initial&gt; students with their scheduling conflicts. 
<Sync time="2641.009"/>
Additionally, some citizens have voiced adding American history into our curriculum, so students will learn about Pearl Harbor, the Cold War, and other important political events that happened in recent times. 
<Sync time="2651.022"/>
With Regards to our primary role approving the budget, I just have one update. I would propose televising the meetings, the pre-budget meetings, so people can watch from home. 
<Sync time="2661.561"/>
I continue to support safety initiatives in all our schools. We are adopting the See Something, Say Something app. We formed a partnership with the Medford Police in team Medford named Pals for &lt;initial&gt; K &lt;/initial&gt; to five. 
<Sync time="2671.991"/>
We continuously work with our police department and fire department and all making improvements in all our schools.
<Sync time="2678.098"/>
There were lots of areas for growth in the Medford School system, in particular, I'd like to begin discussions about the process to transition our schools to a zero-waste school system. 
<Sync time="2687.066"/>
This will better our community and combat the increasing problems of environmental degradation. 
<Sync time="2692.136"/>
Furthermore, I'd like to continue to support the Credit for Life Fair for the eleventh graders and add a final seminar to educate high school seniors about banking skills to ensure our graduating seniors will have the essential skills they need to be financially healthy in college or career.
<Sync time="2707.037"/>
Medford Public Schools as a diverse inclusive school district, we celebrate culture throughout the year. For example, the &lt;initial&gt; CCSR &lt;/initial&gt; hosts an Annual Diversity Week. The McGlynn celebrates Ethnic Pride Week and there's many more. 
<Sync time="2718.913"/>
I have attended countless activities in support of all our schools and I will keep and continue to support all schools in the upcoming years. Medford has many green spaces, in particular, the Fells. 
<Sync time="2729.784"/>
I encourage and support outdoor classrooms in all Medford Public Schools. Furthermore, there are enormous sporting events for all ages throughout our city.
<Sync time="2738.041"/>
For example, Girls on the Run, Running of the Leprechauns, Jingle Bell Run, all the various sports. I've participated in these events in the past years and I aspire to participate in many more in the upcoming school years.
<Sync time="2749.524"/>
Equally important, I will work together with the leadership team to move the bar on &lt;initial&gt; M &lt;/initial&gt; CAT scores. When reelected, I will collaborate with the Superintendent, address all these concerns in my goals. 
<Sync time="2759.468"/>
I will continue to ensure students have a strong foundation to support them in life and all students have an opportunity to reach their potential. It has been an amazing experience serving the Medford Community, improving our educational system. 
<Sync time="2770.975"/>
I thank you immensely for your support now and in the past and I aspire to make this next term my best so far. My name is Kathleen Miles Kreatz. I'm running for reelection for my third term for the Medford School Committee. 
<Sync time="2781.881"/>

Okay, number nine. We're almost done. [laugh] First I'd like #uh, my name is Paulette Van der Kloot and I am running for reelection to the Medford School Committee. 
<Sync time="2807.561"/>
I would like to start off by thanking the Medford Democratic City and Medford Ward Six Committees for this opportunity, and I'd like to thank you here in the audience today for your attention and also those at home. 
<Sync time="2818.562"/>
I am truly thankful for the trust that Medford citizens have shown in me over the many years. It has been a great honor to represent you as a school committee member. 
<Sync time="2828.921"/>
The one most absolute constant on the school committee is that there is always work to be done. We have many successes on which to build, small class sizes have been maintained for years. 
<Sync time="2841.274"/>
We have an outstanding civic engagement program, the Center for Civic Engagement and Social Responsibility where students create projects to better the community. John and some of the others already mentioned it. 
<Sync time="2851.62"/>
Our Early Childhood Outreach Program, the Medford Family Network is second to none. Medford High School has strong academic and technical vocational programs. 
<Sync time="2860.717"/>
Our music programs are strong. We provide many extracurricular activities and sports options for students, including the new middle school athletic program.
<Sync time="2870.097"/>
We have strong partnerships with universities, businesses, and labor unions. 
<Sync time="2874.954"/>
Our school budget has been balanced for years and most importantly, we are part of a caring community with great students, dedicated teachers, and many engaged families and citizens. 
<Sync time="2887.559"/>
[noise] As I look toward this next term, these are my priorities. First, I will continue to work for safe and secure school environments. 
<Sync time="2897.272"/>
I will ensure that communication and emergency protocols are effective and appropriate and that common sense security measures are fully funded and implemented.
<Sync time="2907.856"/>
Second, I will continue to work for schools that really work for students and families. For me, that means they have comprehensive programs to meet all students' needs.
<Sync time="2918.667"/>
Clear effective communication from all schools, continued small class sizes, dedicated teachers who are given opportunities for growth, fully funded arts and music education.
<Sync time="2930.634"/>
High-quality afterschool programs that can accept every child in need of services, dyslexia screening, and high-quality interventions.
<Sync time="2939.013"/>
And that we continue to support the Medford Family Network and our early childhood education initiatives.
<Sync time="2945.427"/>
Third, the physical and emotional well~ health of every student is paramount. We have increased counseling services and expanded programs that address issues of anxiety and depression. 
<Sync time="2958.397"/>
And though we do have programs regarding opioid and vaping awareness, we must double down on these efforts to educate both students and parents. 
<Sync time="2968.179"/>
Fourth, I will plan and work for the future by advocating for a fair share of state and federal resources, pushing for the longterm revitalization of Medford High School, supporting Green initiatives and vital technology updates.
<Sync time="2983.112"/>
Developing a five-year district strategic plan and ensuring that the longterm capital project plan, which the school committee put together this spring, is not left by the wayside.
<Sync time="2995.393"/>
And the projects we outlined are completed. 
<Sync time="2999.028"/>
Lastly, I believe it is time to establish our own benchmarks of success that we can use to measure the effectiveness of our schools rather than relying on one controversial test. 
<Sync time="3011.326"/>
Many have wondered why I continue to want to be on the school committee. After all, I started as a young mother and now I am a young grandmother. 
<Sync time="3022.695"/>
The answer is this, I feel extraordinarily, I feel an extraordinary sense of responsibility to the citizens of Medford.
<Sync time="3030.797"/>
Our new Superintendent of Schools, doctor Marice Edouard-Vincent is wonderful as is our new Assistant Superintendent, doctor Peter Cushing.
<Sync time="3041.212"/>
But both are new to their roles and both are new to the Medford Public Schools. 
<Sync time="3046.16"/>
I bring persistence, care, common sense and passion to my work on the school committee, and I bring continuity and hard-earned experience. 
<Sync time="3059.081"/>
Our community is strengthened when we have schools that enable our children to grow into articulate, knowledgeable, and resilient adults. And by the way, I have to mention, I think we're doing a pretty good job if you just listen to John Intoppa.
<Sync time="3072.446"/>
I truly love this work and you can count on me to be there for you and your family. On election day Tuesday, November fifth please give a hoot and vote for me, Paulette Van der Kloot.

&lt;lang:Foreign&gt; error 13  &lt;lang:Foreign&gt; The first step to that is a feasibility study to understand the cost of renovations to our middle schools.

<Sync time="3285.186"/>
&lt;lang:Foreign&gt; error 14  &lt;lang:Foreign&gt;&gt; Finally, I will do my best to keep the focus on the on needing to deal with our carbon footprint. As the environment continues to warm, we will have significant increases in the number of school days where it is too hot to actually learn anything at our high school. 
<Sync time="3299.728"/>
[lipsmack] Research has shown the classrooms get too when classrooms are too hot, students have diminished abilities to learn and perform. I am not convinced we can renovate our way out of this with our high school. 
<Sync time="3311.854"/>
#um, and I look forward to the Vision Committee that is going to be started in January. #um, I am hopeful that we can renovate this, but if not, then I I certainly would support a new high school, however, that would work.
<Sync time="3326.083"/>
#um, I think that having a new or dramatically improved high school will help stem the tide of students leaving for charter schools and perhaps bring some of those students back.
<Sync time="3336.788"/>
There are many other challenges facing our schools and our students [lipsmack] and I'd be more than happy to sit down and discuss any of them with you. Please reach out to me if you have any questions, feedback or suggestions on how we can improve our school system.
